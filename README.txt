Hello!

This project is my attempt at creating a website for a fake seafood restaurant named "Mark's"
All information and pictures regarding the website are generated by AI and is not real information.

The website is split into four pages: a main information page, a page for the menu, a contact page, and a gallery.
The website includes features such as an interactive navigation bar, formatted pictures, hyperlinks, and well organized, clean text.

Thank you for checking out my code!
